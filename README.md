# Toy-Tracer
This is my personal Path Tracer code. I'm writing this as I read PBRT, it now supports Volumetric effects and subsurface scattering (might have bugs tho), a few images:

This also supports SDFs and Ray Marching, the following was generated by composing triangle/spheres SDFs:

As I develop, this became my personal favorite thing to render with. I also work with Fluids (SPH, PIC, APIC, Boundaries, etc...)
and this is the code I use to render some fluid images:

This one actually has a bug from when I was developing it, I only caught it later on (and so the noisy image) but I find
it lovely still, so let it be :)
